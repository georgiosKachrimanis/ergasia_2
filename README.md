# ergasia_2
This is an ongoing project for my University course of Telecommunications class.
The idea is at the end of the semester to have a functional website. 

The website will be a platform for gas station all over Greece offering discounts on various types of gasoline for 
as sort period of time.

The project will start with a basic HTML CSS design and more functionality will be added using JS, PHP XML etc.
